"""
Audit IELTS content against the real exam's form
================================================
The IELTS courses were generated as ordinary app exercises wearing IELTS
titles. This measures the distance between what is stored and what the exam
actually looks like, so the gap is a number rather than an impression.

What it checks, and why each rule exists:

- **A listening question needs a recording.** 52 questions on production say
  "in the lecture…" / "the speaker claims…" while no exercise in the database
  carries an audio field. Nothing plays, so the learner is guessing.
- **True/False is not an IELTS task.** Reading uses TRUE / FALSE / NOT GIVEN
  and YES / NO / NOT GIVEN — three options. A two-option item trains the wrong
  reflex: "not stated" is the option candidates most often miss.
- **IELTS is monolingual.** A matching task pairing English with Vietnamese is
  a vocabulary drill, not an exam task.
- **A completion answer is at most three words.** "NO MORE THAN THREE WORDS" is
  the standard rubric; a sentence-long gap answer cannot be marked.
- **A full mock must be full length.** Listening and Reading are 40 questions.
  A five-question "Full Mock Test" reports a band it cannot support.
- **Every lesson needs a skill label.** Without it the completion is credited
  to vocabulary, which is why listening and writing scores stay near zero.
