"""
Generate High-Quality Course Exercises via Groq
===============================================
Queries the database for lessons with empty content (or, with --regenerate,
lessons whose content is playable but weak), calls Groq concurrently over the
configured key pool to generate 5 exercises per lesson from the course topic,
level and lesson title, maps them to visual templates (ui_type), and saves
them. A lesson is only overwritten once the new set passes sanitize_exercises.

Run:
    cd backend-service
    venv/bin/python3 scripts/generate_exercises_ai.py
    venv/bin/python3 scripts/generate_exercises_ai.py --regenerate --concurrency=2 --delay=6

    - Unit Title: {unit_title}
    - Lesson Title: {lesson_title}
    
    You must return a JSON object with a single key "exercises" containing a list of 5 exercise objects.
    Each exercise object in the list must match the following format exactly:
    {{
      "id": "ex_{lesson_id}_1", // Replace 1 with 1-5 index
      "type": "multiple_choice" | "true_false" | "fill_blank" | "translate" | "matching",

      // a question that refers to a picture is unanswerable in the app.

      "question": "The question text. For fill_in_the_blank, dialogue_completion, dictation, or grammar_correction where the user is filling a gap, you MUST use the exact string '{{blank}}' inside the question to represent the gap.",
      "options": [
         // List of strings if multiple_choice, true_false, translation_choice or collocation_choice.
         // For match_word_to_meaning, categorization, or cognitive_fluidity (matching type), this must be a list of 4 items:
         // the first 2 are keys (words) and the next 2 are values (meanings). E.g. ["dog", "cat", "con chó", "con mèo"]
      ],
      "correct_answer": "The correct answer text. For matching/categorization type, this must format as 'key1:value1, key2:value2' (e.g. 'dog:con chó, cat:con mèo'). For fill_in_the_blank, dialogue_completion, or dictation, this should be the exact word(s) that replace '{{blank}}'.",
      "explanation": "Brief explanation of why this answer is correct."
    }}
    
    Pedagogical Guidelines:
    1. Exercises must be highly relevant to '{lesson_title}' and match the {level} difficulty.
    2. All 5 exercises MUST use 5 different ui_type values, and at least one of them
       must be a production task (short_writing_answer, dictation, speaking_repeat,
       pronunciation_practice or grammar_correction) — a lesson of 5 recognition
       questions teaches nothing.
    2b. Write every 'question' around this lesson's own content. Never reuse a generic
       instruction such as "Match the words with their meanings"; say what is being
       matched, e.g. "Match each kitchen object with its Vietnamese meaning".
    3. Ensure matching/categorization exercises contain 4 items in 'options' and their correct_answer matches the 'key1:value1, key2:value2' format.
    4. For fill_in_the_blank and dialogue_completion, include '{{blank}}' in the question.
    5. The learners are Vietnamese speakers studying English. Every translation,
       gloss or meaning MUST be Vietnamese (with correct diacritics) — never any
       other language. The prompt text itself stays in English.
    6. For true_false / true_or_false, 'options' MUST be exactly ["True", "False"]
       and 'correct_answer' MUST be either "True" or "False".
    7. For vocabulary_flashcard, 'options' MUST contain at least 2 real choices and
       'correct_answer' MUST be one of them — never a single "Got it!" button.
    7b. For short_writing_answer, 'correct_answer' is ONE model sentence in English
       only. Never pack a translation next to it ("English | Tiếng Việt"): the
       grader compares the learner's writing against this string verbatim.
    8. For arrange_the_sentence, 'options' MUST be the words of the sentence in
       shuffled order (one word per item, no punctuation) and 'correct_answer'
       MUST be the full sentence built from exactly those words — never a list of
       candidate sentences.
